      "question": "How is Nikola Jokic performing this season?",
      "response": "Brother, Nikola Jokic is straight up ballin' this season, no two ways about it. As of the start of April, he's pushing out an average of 26.8 points per game, which has him 9th in the league - that's a big step up from his career average of 18.7 points. \n\nHis rebounds? Man's pulling down an average of 13.6 per game, making him 2nd in the league! Look at those assists too, 8 per game which ranks him 6th. It's all looking pretty sweet compared to his career averages. \n\nNow, his shooting? Some may say he's slacking, but I say he's holding his own. Field goal percentage sitting at 56.6%, three-point at 34.5%, and free-throw at 80.2%. His threes are a smidge below his norm, but fr, who's nitpicking? \n\nAnd check this, his Player Efficiency Rating (PER) is a whopping 31.4, which has him chilling at the top of the league, and his Win Shares? Also leading the league at 15.0. \n\nIn short, Jokic is killing it this season - outplaying his career averages and leading the league in key metrics. MVP material, I'd say.",

Typical recovery for that is like 9-12 months, so we're hoping to see him back on the court in the 2022-2023 season.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is also out. Had friggin' back surgery in December 2021. They're saying he's gonna be out for the rest of the 2021-2022 season. And guess what? Vlatko Cancar is sitting out too 'cause of a foot fracture. Happened during practice in February 2022.\n\nAnd yeah, let's not forget Zeke Nnaji. Got a knee sprain and no one knows when he'll be back. So you can see, brother, the Nuggets gave the injury bug a cozy home this season.",
