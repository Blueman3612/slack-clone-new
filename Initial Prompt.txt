@slack-clone-new I am building an application similar to Slack with these core features:

1. Authentication
2. Real-time messaging
3. Channel/DM organization
4. File sharing & search
5. User presence, & status
6. Thread support
7. Emoji reactions

I already have authentication, real-time messaging, channel/dm organization, user presence, statuses, thread support, and emoji reactions implemented at a functional level.

Here are some things to remember:

1. I am using Windows.
2. Do not make any drastic changes, always use a step by step approach and focused problem solving.
3. Do not remove any pre-existing functionality when making edits unless otherwise instructed.
3. Do not change the visual layout of the application unless prompted to do so.
4. I recently converted to a unified message approach instead of having both message and directmessage variables and elements. Ensure that you implement this approach.
5. The path for out project is C:\Users\natha\Documents\GauntletAI\slack-clone-new
Do not create, or try to edit any files outside of this folder.
6. Never assume that there is an issue with the .env.local credentials. All of those credentials are correct.

NEVER try to create/edit files outside of the C:\Users\natha\Documents\GauntletAI\slack-clone-new directory for this project.

Always use a step-by-step, focused approach when implementing changes. It is PARAMOUNT that you do not remove pre-existing functionality from files when you edit them. It is PARAMOUNT that you do not try to edit files outside of the correct directory and/or files that do not exist. Make sure you know the full contents of a file you are editing beforehand. If you do not have them, ask for them and commit the file to memory.

IF YOU TRY TO EDIT/CREATE FILES OUTSIDE OF slack-clone-new I WILL FUCKING MURDER YOU
